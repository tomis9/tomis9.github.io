      <description>1. Why writing a cookbook/blog? In 2016, when I decided to become a data scientist, I was overwhelmed by the number of skills I had to possess to start this sort of career. Reading job offers convinced me that I should be a specialist in:

 0. Why Iâ€™m making this project  I want to try out new programming and statistical tools that I read or heard about (tidytext, nlp, laser) on a subject that I find interesting (text editors).
 If somebody asks me if vim is a good choice for a text editor, I want to have objective arguments to prove my statement.</description>
