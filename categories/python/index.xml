      <description>1. What is beautiful soup and why would you use it?  it&amp;rsquo;s a web scraping Python package
 sometimes your data is allocated on various pages on the internet. Beautiful Soup turns out to be super-helpful in automated collecting of this sort of data.
  btw. I love the name. It sounds so randomly.
2. The basics Beautiful Soup can &amp;ldquo;understand&amp;rdquo; html code, which you download from the internet using requests module:</description>

      <title>learning tensorflow</title>

      <description>The best way to gain intuiton to any new thing you learn is to start from a very beginning and play with it (let’s see what happens if I do this). That’s the power of reinforcement learning ;)
These packages will be useful in the nearest future:
import numpy as np from sklearn.datasets import load_iris from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score import tensorflow as tf ## /usr/local/lib/python3.</description>

      <description>This is not a proper blog post yet, just my notes. pandas (TODO)   1. What is pandas and why would you use it?  pandas is a Python package created for working with tables known as DataFrames;
 it is the only reasonable Python package for this purpose, which makes Python a little modest comparing to R (base, data.table, dplyr - every one of them has a better interface than pandas) when we process tables;</description>

      <description>1. What is pytorch and why would you use it?  pytorch is a python package which makes learning deep neaural networks relatively easy and fast
 it’s main “rival” is tensorflow, as pytorch was released by Facebook, but tensorflow by Google
   2. “Hello world” example  inspired by this article
 Let’s define some data:
import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt theta = 2 x = np.</description>

      <description>1. What is tensorflow and why would you use it?  tensorflow is a machine learning framework
 which has APIs to Python, C++ and R
 and let&amp;rsquo;s you evaluate any machine learning algorithm, especially deep learning:
 quickly (all the computations are performed in C++)
 easily - you can view your results in a GUI - Tensorboard
 on a huge amount of data, as tensorflow scales easily to many machines and can even make use of GPU.</description>

      <description>1. What is spark and why would use use it?  Spark is a smooth framework for working with big data, i.e. hdfs;
 it can be accessed from Python, R, scala (spark is actually written in scala) and java;
 it is probably the most popular big data tool nowadays for data scientists.
  2. A few &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; examples a) pyspark Prerequisites Installation of pyspark In this tutorial we will work on a development python version of spark.</description>

      <description>1. What is logging and why would you use it?  Logging, in general, sends information about the execution of a program to the outside of the program, e.g. to stdout or to a file. Why would that be useful?
 You may get the information of how and when the program was executed, e.g. who was using it&amp;rsquo;s functionalities and if all the pieces of your program finished correctly.</description>

      <guid>https://tomis9.github.io/sqlalchemy/</guid>
      <description>1. What is sqlAlchemy and why would you use it?  sqlAlchemy is a python module that enables you to connect to and use sql databases without writing code in sql;
 using sqlAlchemy has several advantages:
 you will avoid using long sql strings in your code, which are difficult to read without syntax highlighting (unless you keep you sql queries in separate sql files);
 you are not vulnerable to sql injection attacks anymore;</description>

      <guid>https://tomis9.github.io/airflow/</guid>
      <description>1. What is airflow and why would you use it?  airflow lets you manage your dataflow as a graph (direct acyclic graph or DAG), wchich consists of separate Tasks, and schedule them  Wait, you may say, I can do that with cron!
Yes, you can, but with airflow:
 you can easily divide your app into smaller tasks and monitor their reliability and execution duration;
 the performance is more transparent;</description>

      <guid>https://tomis9.github.io/flask/</guid>
      <description>1. What is flask and why would you use it?  flask is a python framwework for creating web applications and apis;
 it provides a full and simple support for backend, while you still create the frontend with html+css+javascript.
  For production use it is not as popular as Django, as id does not scale that well to huge projects. However in data science you will not create such huge webservices and flask, with it&amp;rsquo;s simplicity, reliability, clearness and great community support is more than enough.</description>

      <guid>https://tomis9.github.io/pyenv/</guid>
      <description>1. What are pyenv, virtualenv and freeze and why would you use them?  these three Python packages let you install your favourite Python version with your favourite Python packages&amp;rsquo; versions on any machine independently to those already installed on the system; you can even store many Python versions and Python packages&amp;rsquo; versions;
 pyenv let&amp;rsquo;s you install any Python version you like;
 virtualenv let&amp;rsquo;s you install any Python&amp;rsquo;s package version you like;</description>

      <guid>https://tomis9.github.io/decorators/</guid>
      <description>1. What are decorators and why would you use them?  decorators in Python are special functions that take a function as an argument and slightly change it’s behaviour, e.g. it’s return value;
 you can write your own decorators, which is rather easy (I highly recommend Fluent Python as a reference)
 but there are already many useful decorators available in Python.
  I am not going to describe here how to write your own decorator as, to be honest, I used them only twice in my career.</description>

      <guid>https://tomis9.github.io/testing/</guid>
      <description>1. What is testing and why would you use it?  testing or test-driven development (TDD) is a discipline, which relies on writing a test for every functionality before creating it;
 at first the test will fail, as we have not provided the proper functionality yet. Our goal is to fulfill this functionality, so the test will pass.
  In reality you modify your tests as you create the functionality or even write the tests after you are finished writing it.</description>
