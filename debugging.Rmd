## 1. What is debugging and why would use use it?

* According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging), "Debugging is the process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system".

* R provides a couple of useful functions, which may be used not only for debugging purposes, but also for testing and even developing code.

* All the functions present below are already available within basic packages (no installation required).

## 2. Functions frequently used for debugging purposes

* ### `browser()` 

Rarely used directly, but important to understand how `debug()` works.

A short example:

Let's say that function `my_function` returns an error. (In this case we cause an error intentionally.)

```{r, error = TRUE}
my_function <- function(x) {
  print(x)
  stop("This is an error.")
  print(x + 10)
}
my_function(x = 2)
```

In order to find out where exactly the error occured, i.e. which statement caused it, we may enter the function's body and run the statements line by line.
```{r, error = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
my_function <- function(x) {
  browser()  # just add this line of code into your function's definition 
  print(x)
  stop("This is an error.")
  print(x + 10)
}
my_function(x = 2)
```
Right now you are in `my_function()`'s environment, which you can check by typing `environment()` or `ls()`. You can also see that the prompt has changed. Type <kbd>n</kbd> until you get to the line of code which produces an error.

*Tip*: To skip a loop, type <kbd>c</kbd>.

To quit `browser()` earlier, type <kbd>q</kbd> and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

* ### `debug()`, `undebug()` and `debugonce()`

Or the most useful debugging functions.

Let's assume that you invoke a function inside of a function:

```{r, error = TRUE}
my_inside_function <- function(x_inside) {
  print(paste("x_inside: ", x_inside + 10))
  print("after error")
}
my_function <- function(x) {
  print(x)
  my_inside_function("some text")
  print(x + 10)
}
my_function(x = 2)
```

which produces an error. You don't know yet where exactly the error ocurred, so now you should write:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
debug(my_function)
my_function(x = 2)
```

to start searching for the bug right from the top function. A new, weird-looking prompt appears: it is the same prompt as invoked by the `browser()` function, inside `my_function`. Type `ls()` and you will see that you actually *are* inside of `my_function`'s environment. Hit <kbd>n</kbd> a couple of times until you reach the error. You can see that it was `my_inside_function` that caused an error. Debugging `my_inside_function` will lead you straight to the statement which caused an error, but before entering `my_inside_function`, stop observing `my_function`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
undebug(my_function)
```

And then debug `my_inside_function`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
debug(my_inside_function)
my_function(x = 2)
```

After you find an error, don't forget to stop observing the function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
undebug(my_inside_function)
```

You can also use `debugonce()`, the name of which is rather self-explanatory.

* ### `traceback()` 

A quick view of where the bug may come from.


(from R docs)


Our example code:
```{r, error = TRUE}
foo <- function(x) { print(1); bar(2) }
bar <- function(x) { x + a.variable.which.does.not.exist }
foo(2)
```

produces a strange error.

```{r, error = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
traceback()
## End(Not run)
## 2: bar(2)
## 1: foo(2)
```

As you can see, `traceback()` immediately points at the line where the error occured.


* ### Other debugging functions

There are two other functions that may be used for debugging, but as they are rarely used, I will not describe them in detail.

* `trace()` 

* `recover()`
