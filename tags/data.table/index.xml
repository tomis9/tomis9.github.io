      <title>tidyverse</title>

      <description>1. What is tidyverse and why would you use it?  tidyverse is a collection of R packages that make working on data a much nicer experience than using base R;
 it consists of tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2, tibble and a few more.
  To be honest, I prefer data.table to tidyverse, as it resembles basic R data.frames, is faster, more concise and, IMHO, more SQL-ish. But it takes longer to master and may be more difficult to understand, even your own code after some time.</description>

      <description>1. What is data.table and why would you use it?  data.table is an R packge which let’s you work on tabular datasets quickly and easily;
 comparing to base R or dplyr it’s significantly faster;
 data.table has a concise and SQL-like syntax.
   2. Basic functionalities Creating a data.table library(data.table) df &amp;lt;- data.frame(x = c(&amp;quot;b&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;b&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;b&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;), v = rnorm(5)) dt &amp;lt;- data.table(x = c(&amp;quot;b&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;b&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;b&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;), v = rnorm(5)) is exactly the same as creating a data.</description>

      <title>reshape2</title>

      <description>1. What is reshape2 and why would you use it? reshape2 is an R package that let’s you change the shape of any dataframe, i.e. to pivot and to “unpivot”.
Keep in mind that if your favourite R package for dataframes manipulation is data.table, functions dcast and melt are already in this package and work exactly the same as those in reshape2.
 2. A “Hello World” example In fact there are only two functions worth mentioning: dcast, which is equivalent to MS Excel pivot table, and melt, which does the opposite or unpivots a table.</description>
