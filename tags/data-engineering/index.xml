      <description>1. What is hadoop and why would you use it?  hadoop is the first popular big data tool ever;
 it let&amp;rsquo;s you &amp;ldquo;quickly&amp;rdquo; compute huge amounts of data thanks to dividing computation into many machines (a cluster of machines); &amp;ldquo;quickly&amp;rdquo; comparing to a standard, one-machine approach;
 you can store and easily access huge amounts of data thanks to hadoop&amp;rsquo;s distributed file system (hdfs);
 in general, hadoop is a cornerstone of big data.</description>

      <description>1. What is spark and why would use use it?  Spark is a smooth framework for working with big data, i.e. hdfs;
 it can be accessed from Python, R, scala (spark is actually written in scala) and java;
 it is probably the most popular big data tool nowadays for data scientists.
  2. A few &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; examples a) pyspark Prerequisites Installation of pyspark In this tutorial we will work on a development python version of spark.</description>

      <description>1. What is logging and why would you use it?  Logging, in general, sends information about the execution of a program to the outside of the program, e.g. to stdout or to a file. Why would that be useful?
 You may get the information of how and when the program was executed, e.g. who was using it&amp;rsquo;s functionalities and if all the pieces of your program finished correctly.</description>

      <description>1. What is testing and why would you use it?  testing or test-driven development (TDD) is a discipline, which relies on writing a test for every functionality before creating it;
 at first the test will fail, as we have not provided the proper functionality yet. Our goal is to fulfill this functionality, so the test will pass.
  In reality you modify your tests as you create the functionality or even write the tests after you are finished writing it.</description>
