      <description>1. What is flask and why would you use it?  flask is a python framwework for creating web applications and apis;
 it provides a full and simple support for backend, while you still create the frontend with html+css+javascript.
  For production use it is not as popular as Django, as id does not scale that well to huge projects. However in data science you will not create such huge webservices and flask, with it&amp;rsquo;s simplicity, reliability, clearness and great community support is more than enough.</description>
