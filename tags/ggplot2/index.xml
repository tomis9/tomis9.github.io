      <description>1. What is tidyverse and why would you use it?  tidyverse is a collection of R packages that make working on data a much nicer experience than using base R;
 it consists of tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2, tibble and a few more.
  To be honest, I prefer data.table to tidyverse, as it resembles basic R data.frames, is faster, more concise and, IMHO, more SQL-ish. But it takes longer to master and may be more difficult to understand, even your own code after some time.</description>

      <description>1. What is ggplot2 and why would you use it?  ggplot2 is an R package which makes creating nice-looking plots easy;
 the plots you create are highly customisable;
  Once you learn ggplot2, you will not make any production plots using basic R. However, due to itâ€™s verbosity, for simple exploratory analysis I still use basic functions: plot, lines, hist and boxplot.</description>
