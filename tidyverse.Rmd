## 1. What is tidyverse and why would you use it? 

* [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of R packages that make working on data a much nicer experience than using base R;

* it consists of tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2, tibble and a few more.

To be honest, I prefer [data.table](http://tomis9.com/data.table) to tidyverse, as it resembles basic R data.frames, is faster, more concise and, IMHO, more SQL-ish. But it takes longer to master and may be more difficult to understand, even your own code after some time. So, there is no obvious choice between data.table and dplyr.

## 2. A few "Hello World" examples 

### readr 

Or how do we read and write data in `tidyverse`.

Nobody uses basic R functions to read tabular data anymore. `data.table::fread()` and `readr::read_csv()` are smarter and faster.

Let's create a sample dataset:

```{r}
sample_data <- data.frame(
  col_a = letters[1:5],
  col_b = sample(1:100, 5)
)

class(sample_data)
```

Then let's write it and read back to R:
```{r}
readr::write_csv(x = sample_data, path = 'sample_data.csv')

data_t <- readr::read_csv(file = 'sample_data.csv')
```

As you can see, readr was happy to inform us that it imported column `col_a` as characters and column `col_b` as integers, which is exactly what we wanted. You can customise this behaviour. How to do it? `readr` has an extensive documentation ;).

The data we read is an object of class "tibble", which has a nice printing method.
```{r}
class(data_t)
print(data_t)
```
Tibbles do not differ much from data.frames, except (according to the documentation, i.e. `?tibble::tibble`):

>     ‘tibble()’ is a trimmed down version of ‘data.frame()’ that:
>
>        • Never coerces inputs (i.e. strings stay as strings!).
>
>        • Never adds ‘row.names’.
>
>        • Never munges column names.
>
>        • Only recycles length 1 inputs.
>
>        • Evaluates its arguments lazily and in order.
>
>        • Adds ‘tbl_df’ class to output.
>
>        • Automatically adds column names.
>
>     ‘data_frame()’ is an alias to ‘tibble()’.

Btw, to create a tibble by hand, you use:

```{r}
tibble::data_frame(a = 1:5, b = letters[1:5])
```
So it's exactly the same as creating a usual `data.frame`.


### dplyr 

Or smart SQL (DDL + DML) in R.

Let's have a look at the most common expressions:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```
As you can see, if you use function `filter()`, the one from dplyr package will be run.

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
    select(mpg, cyl, disp) %>% 
    filter(cyl == 8) %>% 
    arrange(-disp) %>%
    mutate(col_a = cyl * 2, col_b = "hi") %>%
    head()
```

What happened here:

* we used one of basic R datasets: mtcars;

* we piped it with `%>%` to the next function *(piping, or pipelines, is one of the oldest Unix concepts, dating back to 1970s)*;

* we used a `select` to select columns we were interested in, just like in SQL;

* we used a `filter` function just as SQL's where clause;

* we ordered the dataset with `arrange`;

* we added two new columns with `mutate`;

* we used a `head()` function to print only a few first rows of our dataframe.

An example of grouping:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
    group_by(cyl) %>% 
    summarise(count = n(), mean_hp = mean(hp))
```

What happened here:

* we aggregated our data with `group_by` in the same way as we do in SQL;

* we wrote the aggregation functions: `n()` stands for number of objects or `count` in SQL and `mean()` is an example of an aggreagtion function (`sum`, `sd`, `median`, ...)

Another example of grouping, woth count (count is exactly the same as `group_by() %>% summarise(n = n())`, but shorter):

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
    count(cyl)
```

### ggplot2 

I prepared a separate tutorial for [ggplot2](http://tomis9.com/ggplot2).

## 3. Curiosities 

* you can pipe your data directly to ggplot2

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

mtcars %>% 
    filter(gear >= 4) %>% 
    ggplot(mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = cyl)) + 
    geom_point()
```

But remember that in ggplot2 we use `+` for piping, not `%>%`. There is an easy way to never forget about it: use data.table instead of dplyr ;).

* you can use `%>%` operators on any class of data you like, e.g.:

```{r}
data.table::as.data.table(mtcars) %>% 
    filter(mpg > 21) %>% 
    select(mpg, cyl) %>% 
    head()
```

## 4. Subjects still to cover: 

* dplyr: joins, slice, spread, separate/unite (TODO) (spread is dcast)

* table of contents
