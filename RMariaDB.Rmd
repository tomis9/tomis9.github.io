## 1. What is RMariaDB and why would you use it? 

* `RMariaDB` is an R package available at CRAN that let's you connect to various SQL databases easily.

Why did I switch from RMySQL to RMariaDB? Because of invalid long integer format when downloading data from a database. A pretty nasty bug in RMySQL, which was resolved in RMariaDB.

## 2. Usage 

First you have to create a connection to the database. Remember that you should not provide any credentials in your scripts! Keep them in a separate file or in envorionment variables.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
con <- RMariaDB::dbConnect(
  drv      = RMariaDB::MariaDB(), 
  user     = "",
  password = "",
  host     = "", 
  dbname   = ""
)
```
After you are done with working on your database data, you should close the connection with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
RMariaDB::dbDisconnect(con)
```

### a) using plain R 

* ### just querying
```{r, eval = FALSE}
query <- "delete from my_table;"

RMariaDB::dbSendQuery(con, query)
```

* ### retrieving data from db
```{r, eval = FALSE}
query <- "select * from my_table;"

rs <- RMariaDB::dbSendQuery(con, query)
tab <- RMariaDB::dbFetch(rs, n = -1)
RMariaDB::dbClearResult(rs)

# equivalent to select * from my_table;
d <- RMariaDB::dbReadTable(con, "my_table")
```

* ### sending data to db
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# data.frame's colnames should be the same as in the database
dt <- data.frame(id = 1:10, text = letters[1:10])

RMariaDB::dbWriteTable(
  conn = con, 
  name = "my_table", 
  value = dt, 
  overwrite = FALSE,
  append = TRUE,
  row.names = F
)
```

### b) using [dplyr](http://tomis9.com/tidyverse/#/dplyr) 

* #### just querying / retrieving data from db

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tab_name <- dplyr::tbl(con, "tab_name")
tab <- dplyr::collect(tab_name)  # you can `library(dplyr)` and then `tab_name %>% collect()`
```

* ### sending data to db

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dplyr::db_insert_into(con, "my_table", tab)
```
