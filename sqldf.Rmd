## 1. What is sqldf and why would you use it?

`sqldf` package lets you treat any data.frame object as an sql table. You can write queries as if you were in a database. Pretty useless, comparing to, say, data.table or dplyr + tidyverse.

Despite it's uselessness, it works like a charm.


## 2. A few basic examples:

Load the package:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(sqldf)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(sqldf))
```

Selecting specific columns:
```{r}
sqldf('select mpg, cyl, disp from mtcars where cyl = 6')
```

A simple where clause:
```{r}
sqldf('select * from mtcars where mpg > 21')
```

Group by and order by:
```{r}
sqldf('select cyl, count(*) number from mtcars group by cyl order by cyl')
```

Joins:
```{r}
customers <- data.frame(
  id_customers = c(1, 2, 3),
  name = c("Zidane", "Figo", "Beckham")
)
orders <- data.frame(
  id_orders = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  id_customers = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 1),
  products = c("fotball", "shoes", "t-shirt", "shoes", "energy drink")
)

sqldf("select * from customers c join orders o on c.id_customers = o.id_customers")
```

Subqueries:
```{r}
sqldf('select a.mpg from (select mpg, cyl, disp from mtcars where cyl = 6) as a')
```

As you can see, all the sql operations are available in `sqldf`.
