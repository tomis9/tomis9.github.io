Rmarkdown (TODO)
</center>


Before you begin, check out a very nice cheatsheet available at 
https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf

Vim key mappings are rather intuitive, pretty similar to basic r filetype mappings:
<F2> open up a console window,
<F5> rmarkdown::render()s this file and shows the result in your favourite browser. 

In general, Rmarkdown is just markdown with a possibility to add R chunks of code and execute them. Which is pretty nice, actually. Some more informationon http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html

***

By the way, it would be great if you could have separate keys for rendering and showing the results, like <F5> and <F6>, for example.

And if there was a snippet 
https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets
for rmarkdown so you didn't have to make up your own description block every single time you create a new file. Yeah, you'd love it.

I am sorry but I am too lazy to add these features right now :) Good luck, anyways.


```{r}
x <- 10
print(x)
```

# Some title
just the same function to create a title as in basic markdown

and some plot

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(mtcars)
```

You can also execute bash and probably some other languages as well. That's pretty impressive.
```{bash}
ls
echo "some random text"
```
